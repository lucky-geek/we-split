# WeSplit

My first SwiftUI app - WeSplit. I worked on this project as part of 100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge.

In this app I experimented with: 

Item  | Description
------------- | -------------
@State  | stores property in shared storage managed by SwiftUI
@FocusState  |  tracks which view currently receives user input
TextField format | formats the view according to input type and restrict input
keyboardType | uses to attach keyboard of a specific type to a particular input field
pickerStyle | formats the style and layout of the picker input 
toolbar | populates a toolbar with a collection of views
