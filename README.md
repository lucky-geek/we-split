# WeSplit

My first SwiftUI app - WeSplit. I worked on this project as part of 100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge.

In this app I experimented with: 

Item  | Description
------------- | -------------
@State  | stores property in shared storage managed by SwiftUI
@FocusState  |  
TextField format | 
keyboardType | 
Picker and pickerStyle | 
toolbar |
